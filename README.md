I am Dody Gunawinata. You probably know me from the rather popular [Practical ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore) project.

I am an Indonesian developer currently based in Cairo, Egypt. I am a co-founder of [SilverKey Technologies](https://www.silverkeytech.com/), a software consultancy that works a lot in building software in development sector (IOM, ILO, GIZ, USAID, Egyptian Government, etc). 

On my spare time I run a small desert travel outfit called [Siwawi](https://siwawi.com/). We take people exploring the wonderful and historic Siwa Oasis and the Sahara desert.

My technology interests currently are:

- [Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/)
- [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/)
- [Orchard Core CMS](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore)
