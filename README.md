My name is Dody Gunawinata. You probably know me from the rather popular [Practical ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore) project.

I come from [a small remote island North of Indonesia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tarakan,+Tarakan+City,+East+Kalimantan,+Indonesia/@-2.2741662,107.61995,5.33z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x32138bb6231349ad:0xe8d9849640f31b7e!8m2!3d3.3273599!4d117.5785049). I am currently based in Cairo, Egypt. This is the seventh country I have worked and lived in. I was trained at [QUT, Australia](https://www.qut.edu.au/) in Software Network Engineering back in 1995. 

I am a co-founder of [SilverKey Technologies](https://www.silverkeytech.com/), a software consultancy that works a lot in building software in development sector (IOM, ILO, GIZ, USAID, Egyptian Government, etc). 

On my spare time I run a small desert travel outfit called [Siwawi](https://siwawi.com/). We take people exploring the wonderful and historic Siwa Oasis and the Sahara desert.

I wrote the first open source Android app written in Kotlin called [Android Rivers](https://github.com/dodyg/AndroidRivers). I think it was around version Kotlin .5. You can see in the [contributions](https://github.com/dodyg/AndroidRivers/graphs/contributors) from JetBrains Kotlin team to the project. I was a really active member of Kotlin community although eventually I lost interest in developing for Android and I couldn't use Kotlin for my day to day work at that time.

9 years ago I started writing [samples for ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore) while I was studying for the framework. It got really popular to my surprise. I still continue to write samples because I found it as an effective learning tool for me and I am glad that many others benefit from them as well.

I am a big admirer of [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) for his work in RSS, Blogging and Podcasting. It's amazing what a single person can contribute to the Internet culture.
