I am Dody Gunawinata. You probably know me from the rather popular [Practical ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore) project.

I am an Indonesian developer currently based in Cairo, Egypt. I am a co-founder of [SilverKey Technologies](https://www.silverkeytech.com/), a software consultancy that works a lot in building software in development sector (IOM, ILO, GIZ, USAID, Egyptian Government, etc). We are an investor and technology partner of Tayary, a pretty cool food/shopping delivery company operating in Alexandria, Egypt. Get it on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tayary.tayaryapp&hl=en)/[Apple](https://apps.apple.com/eg/app/tayary/id1179159599).

On my spare time I run a small desert travel outfit called [Siwawi](https://siwawi.com/). We take people exploring the wonderful and historic Siwa Oasis and the Sahara desert.

My technology interests currently are:

I wrote the first open source Android app written in Kotlin called [Android Rivers](https://github.com/dodyg/AndroidRivers). I think it was around version Kotlin .5. You can see in the [contributions](https://github.com/dodyg/AndroidRivers/graphs/contributors) from JetBrains Kotlin team to the project. I was a really active member of Kotlin community although eventually I lost interest in developing for Android and I couldn't use Kotlin for my day to day work at that time.

4 years ago I started writing [samples for ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore) while I was studying for the framework. It got really popular to my surprise. I still continue to write samples because I found it as an effective learning tool for me and I am glad that many others benefit from them as well.

I am a big admirer of [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/) for his work in RSS, Blogging and Podcasting. It's amazing what a single person can contribute to the Internet culture.
